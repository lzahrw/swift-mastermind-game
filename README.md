# Mastermind CLI (Swift)

A simple terminal-based implementation of the classic **Mastermind** code-breaking game, written in Swift. This version uses an external REST API to manage game sessions and evaluate guesses.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Interactive CLI**: Play directly in your terminal.
- **API-backed**: Leverages the [Mastermind API](https://mastermind.darkube.app) for session management and guess evaluation.
- **Peg Feedback**: Returns black pegs (correct digit & position) and white pegs (correct digit, wrong position).
- **Exit Anytime**: Type `exit` to quit the game.

---

## ðŸ›  Prerequisites

- **Swift 5.8+**  
- **Swift Package Manager** (bundled with Swift)  
- **Network Access** (to reach the Mastermind API)
